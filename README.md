# Ecommerce Advanced SQL Analysis
This repository contains my work from the Maven Analytics Project. Throughout the project, I performed data analytics for Maven Fuzzy Factory, an eCommerce start-up, applying advanced SQL techniques to analyze data, optimize business performance, and drive growth. The analysis covers key aspects of eCommerce performance, including traffic optimization, channel analysis, product-level performance, and user behavior.

## About the Project
In this project, I collaborated directly with the CEO, Marketing Director, and Website Manager to analyze data related to traffic, sales, and customer behavior. The focus was on leveraging SQL queries to extract actionable insights, improve website performance, and optimize marketing strategies. All analysis was performed using MySQL and MySQL Workbench to execute queries, create reports, and visualize findings.

Additionally, I have created a Tableau Story to further explore and visualize the insights gathered during this project. You can access the Tableau dashboard via the following link:

## Key Concepts and Analyses

### 1. **Traffic Analysis & Optimization**
   - **Objective:** Understand and optimize traffic sources for better conversion rates.
   - **Key Metrics:** Traffic volume, conversion rates, bounce rates, and source-based performance.
   - **Insights:** Used SQL to identify high-conversion traffic channels and recommended optimization strategies for underperforming sources.

### 2. **Website Measurement & Testing**
   - **Objective:** Analyze website performance, focusing on the customer purchase experience.
   - **Key Metrics:** Conversion funnel performance, page-level interaction, drop-off rates.
   - **Insights:** Conducted SQL-based analysis of conversion funnels, leading to recommendations for improving user experience and decreasing cart abandonment.

### 3. **Channel Analysis & Optimization**
   - **Objective:** Assess the performance of marketing channels and optimize budgets.
   - **Key Metrics:** Device type performance, channel ROI, and traffic channel mix.
   - **Insights:** Performed time-series analysis to identify seasonality trends and recommended changes to the channel mix for better ROI.

### 4. **Product-Level Analysis**
   - **Objective:** Understand sales performance and optimize product offerings.
   - **Key Metrics:** Product sales, cross-sell patterns, refund rates.
   - **Insights:** Analyzed sales by product category and identified opportunities for cross-selling and reducing refund rates through SQL queries.

### 5. **User-Level Analysis**
   - **Objective:** Identify and retain valuable customers through targeted marketing strategies.
   - **Key Metrics:** Customer lifetime value (CLV), channel preferences, and purchasing behavior.
   - **Insights:** Analyzed customer data to identify high-value customers and developed strategies for improving engagement and retention.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **SQL:** MySQL for querying and analyzing datasets.
- **Database:** MySQL Workbench for creating complex queries and performing data analysis.
